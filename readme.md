## Use Cases


### Finding the factors that affect wine prices (Stakeholders - Vineyard)
Identify the type of grapes vineyard owners should grow in order to maximize profit and meet market demands, taking into account their country and climate. 

### Inventory Management (Stakeholders - Retailers)
Using Causal Inference to see how strongly certain factors (such as origin of wine) influence control/treatment factors (such as vintage) in predicting price of wine. This will allow retailers to mix and match predictors to identify which wines to import to maximize profit while ensuring a diverse enough product range.  

### Recommendation System (Stakeholders - Customers)
Helping customers select wine based on their preferred attributes (e.g. fruity, spicy) and at their specified price points.
